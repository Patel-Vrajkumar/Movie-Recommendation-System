# 🎉 Phase 3 Complete! User Preference Learning

## What We Built

A complete user preference learning system that tracks behavior and personalizes recommendations!

### ✅ New Features

#### 1. **User Sessions & Profiles**
- Automatic user ID assignment via Flask sessions
- Persistent profile storage in `user_data/` folder
- Profile includes ratings, watchlist, views, and preferences

#### 2. **Rating System** ⭐
- Interactive 5-star rating on every movie card
- Hover effects for preview
- Click to rate instantly
- Ratings update user preference profile
- Movies rated 4-5 stars boost related genres/directors/actors

#### 3. **Watchlist** 📋
- Add/remove movies with one click
- Dedicated watchlist page (`/watchlist`)
- Counter in navigation shows watchlist size
- Persistent across sessions

#### 4. **User Profile Page** 👤
- Beautiful stats dashboard:
  - Total ratings
  - Watchlist size
  - Movies viewed
  - Searches made
  - Average rating
- **Top Genres** - Shows your favorite genres with scores
- **Top Directors** - Directors you love most
- **Rated Movies** - Grid of all movies you've rated

#### 5. **Behavior Tracking**
- Search queries logged
- Movie views tracked
- Trailer clicks monitored
- All data used to improve recommendations

#### 6. **Personalized Recommendations** 🎯
- Analyzes your rating history
- Boosts movies matching your preferences:
  - **Genres**: +15% max boost
  - **Directors**: +10% max boost  
  - **Actors**: +5% max boost
- Shows "👤 +X% personal match" badge
- Filters out already-rated movies

### How It Works

#### The Preference Learning Algorithm

1. **When you rate a movie highly (4-5 stars)**:
   ```
   - Extract genres → add 3.0-5.0 points to each genre
   - Extract director → add 3.0-5.0 points to director
   - Extract top 5 actors → add 1.5-2.5 points to each
   - Extract keywords → add 0.9-1.5 points to each
   ```

2. **When finding recommendations**:
   ```
   - Get base AI recommendations (content-based)
   - For each movie, calculate personalization score:
     * Genre match: up to +0.15
     * Director match: up to +0.10
     * Actor match: up to +0.05
     * Total boost: up to +0.30 (30%)
   - Re-rank movies by: base_score + personalization_score
   ```

3. **Example**: If you loved "Interstellar":
   - Science Fiction genre gets +5 points
   - Christopher Nolan gets +5 points
   - Future recommendations with Sci-Fi/Nolan get huge boosts!

## Try It Now!

### 1. Start the server
```powershell
python app.py
```

### 2. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000

### 3. Search for movies and rate them:
- Click the stars to rate (1-5)
- Rate at least 5 movies with 4-5 stars
- See your preferences build up!

### 4. Check your profile:
- Click "👤 Profile" in the header
- See your stats and favorite genres/directors

### 5. Add to watchlist:
- Click the "📋 Watchlist" button on any movie
- Visit the watchlist page

### 6. Watch personalization work:
- After rating 5+ movies, search again
- You'll see "👤 +X% personal match" badges
- Movies matching your taste get boosted!

## Testing

```powershell
# Test the preference system
python test_user_preferences.py
```

This creates a test user who:
- Rates 5 Christopher Nolan/Sci-Fi movies highly
- Builds a watchlist
- Gets personalized recommendations

## User Data Storage

Profiles are stored as JSON in `user_data/`:

```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "ratings": {
    "157336": {"rating": 5, "timestamp": "..."}
  },
  "watchlist": [27205, 155],
  "viewed": [...],
  "preferences": {
    "genres": {"Science Fiction": 5.0, "Drama": 3.0},
    "directors": {"Christopher Nolan": 5.0},
    "actors": {"Matthew McConaughey": 2.5}
  }
}
```

## Personalization in Action

**Without personalization:**
```
Search "Interstellar" → Get generic Sci-Fi movies
```

**With personalization (after rating Nolan films):**
```
Search "Interstellar" → 
  1. Inception (+20% boost - Nolan + Sci-Fi!)
  2. The Prestige (+15% boost - Nolan!)
  3. Dunkirk (+15% boost - Nolan!)
  4. Tenet (+20% boost - Nolan + Sci-Fi!)
```
