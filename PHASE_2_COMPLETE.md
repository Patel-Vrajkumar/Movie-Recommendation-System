Visit: **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

## What's Working Right Now

### 1. Intelligent Movie Recommendations 🤖
- Search for any movie (try "Interstellar", "The Matrix", "Inception")
- Get AI-powered similar movie suggestions
- See match percentages showing how similar each movie is
- Based on actual content analysis, not just keywords

### 2. Beautiful UI 🎨
- Dark theme with golden accents
- Responsive movie cards
- Hover effects and animations
- AI match badges on each recommendation
- Trailer links to YouTube

### 3. Smart Features 🧠
- Analyzes 6 different movie features
- Uses machine learning (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)
- Quality boosting for highly-rated movies
- Filters out low-quality matches
- Toggle between AI and basic search

## Files You Have

### Core Application
- `app.py` - Flask web server
- `recommender.py` - Main recommendation logic with AI toggle
- `ai_recommender.py` - AI engine (225 lines of ML code!)
- `tmdb_service.py` - TMDb API wrapper

### Frontend
- `templates/index.html` - Main page
- `static/style.css` - Styling
- `static/Loader.css` - Loading animations (ready for Phase 4)
- `static/no_image.svg` - Placeholder image

### Testing & Documentation
- `test_ai.py` - Test the AI engine
- `compare_search.py` - Compare AI vs basic search
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `AI_EXPLANATION.md` - How the AI works
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - User guide
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete project info

### Configuration
- `.env` - Your API key (secure!)
- `.env.example` - Template for others
- `.gitignore` - Security
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## How to Use It

### Start the Server
```powershell
cd c:\Users\VRAJKUMA.PATEL\Desktop\MovieRecommenderAI
python app.py
```

### Test the AI
```powershell
python test_ai.py
```

### Compare Methods
```powershell
python compare_search.py
```

## Try These Searches

1. **"Interstellar"** → Space exploration movies
2. **"John Wick"** → Stylish action movies
3. **"The Notebook"** → Romantic dramas
4. **"Get Out"** → Psychological thrillers
5. **"Toy Story"** → Animated adventures

## What the AI Analyzes

For each movie, the AI looks at:
1. **Genres** (Action, Sci-Fi, Drama, etc.)
2. **Director** (Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, etc.)
3. **Keywords** (time travel, heist, family, etc.)
4. **Cast** (Top 5 actors)
5. **Plot** (Overview text analysis)
6. **Crew** (Writers, producers)

Then it finds movies with similar combinations!

## Toggle AI On/Off

Edit `recommender.py` line 4:
```python
USE_AI_RECOMMENDATIONS = True   # AI mode
USE_AI_RECOMMENDATIONS = False  # Basic search mode
```
