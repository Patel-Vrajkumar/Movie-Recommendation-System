# 🎬 Movie Recommender AI

An intelligent movie recommendation system powered by The Movie Database (TMDb) API and machine learning algorithms. Built with Flask and designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and content analysis.

## 🚀 Current Features

### ✅ Phases 1–4 Complete + Early Hybrid CF!

- **📋 Advanced Filters & Sorting**:
  - Filter by Genre (Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi, etc.)
  - Filter by Decade (2020s, 2010s, 2000s, 1990s, Classics)
  - Filter by Minimum Rating (7+, 8+, 9+)
  - Sort by Rating, Year, Title, or AI Relevance

### How the AI Works

When you search for a movie like "Interstellar", the AI:
1. **Analyzes the movie's DNA**: Extracts genres, keywords, cast, director, crew, and plot
2. **Finds candidates**: Gets similar movies from TMDb plus popular releases
3. **Builds feature vectors**: Creates mathematical representations using TF-IDF
4. **Calculates similarity**: Uses cosine similarity to measure how "close" movies are
5. **Ranks intelligently**: Boosts high-quality, well-rated movies
6. **Returns top matches**: Shows you the best recommendations with match scores

## 🎯 Planned / Upcoming Enhancements

### Hybrid Recommendation Expansion
- Refine blending weights between content similarity and CF signals
- Introduce user-personal CF (filter by similar users to the current profile)
- Explore matrix factorization (ALS) for latent factors

### Deeper Personalization
- Use watchlist and rating recency decay
- Diversity balancing (novelty vs similarity)
- Explicit preference sliders (e.g., genre weight)

### UI Improvements
- A/B test list vs grid density modes
- Add persistent user history timeline
- Optional infinite scroll toggle

### Data Enrichment & Quality
- Integrate optional external metadata (awards, certifications) respecting API limits
- Fuzzy duplicate handling / normalization

### Performance Optimization
- Cache CF model & genre lists
- Precompute hybrid vectors for popular anchors
- Batch TMDb details lookups
- Optional Redis layer

## 🧩 MovieLens Integration (New)

We now ingest the MovieLens dataset to power collaborative similarity:

1. `movielens_loader.py` downloads and loads `ratings.csv`, `movies.csv`, `links.csv`.
2. `links.csv` provides `tmdbId` so we can map MovieLens movies to TMDb for posters/details.
3. `movielens_cf.py` builds an item-user matrix and computes top-K cosine neighbors.
4. The model is saved to `models/movielens_cf.pkl` and lazily loaded by `ai_recommender.py`.
5. CF neighbors add a modest hybrid boost (+0.05) to content similarity scoring.
6. If the content vectorization step errors, we fall back to CF neighbors only.

Optional content enrichment: If you have MovieLens tags available alongside links.csv, set an environment variable pointing to the dataset folder to enrich content features with top user tags.

```powershell
$env:MOVIELENS_PATH = "C:\Users\VRAJKUMA.PATEL\Downloads\ml-32m\ml-32m"
```

The app will load top tags per movie (frequency ≥ 5, up to 20 per title) and include them in the feature vectorization.

### Dataset Notes
- Source: [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- License: Non-commercial, research/educational use.
- Recommended starting set: `ml-latest-small` for quick builds; upgrade to `ml-latest` for richer signals.

### Building the CF Model (Manual Step)
Quick build (small set):
```bash
python -c "from movielens_loader import download_movielens, load_movielens; from movielens_cf import build_and_save_cf_model; p=download_movielens(); r,m,l=load_movielens(p); build_and_save_cf_model(r,l)"
```

Large local dataset (e.g. ml-32m) with scalable block-wise similarity:
```powershell
python movielens.py build --dataset-path "C:\\path\\to\\ml-32m" --block-size 1000 --min-item-ratings 10 --top-k 75
```

Outputs `models/movielens_cf.pkl`. The app lazily loads it for hybrid boosts.

Performance tips:
1. Increase `min-item-ratings` to prune very sparse items (improves quality + speed).
2. Use `--blockwise` for datasets > 5M ratings.
3. Adjust `--top-k` downward (e.g. 40) to reduce memory footprint.
4. Keep `block-size` in 500–1500 range; higher uses more RAM but fewer passes.

- Accent (`--accent`): borders, headings, buttons, chips
- Neon (`--neon`): title glow, button hover glow, stars glow

Apply saves to your browser (localStorage) and updates instantly. Reset returns to defaults.

## ❓ Recommendation Explanations ("Why?")

Each recommendation includes a “Why?” button that explains the suggestion using:

- Shared genres
- Cast or director overlap
- Content similarity percentage (from the AI match)
- Personalization boost (if available)

The endpoint `/explain/<movie_id>` returns a reason string and structured fields.
